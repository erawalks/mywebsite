                    <h1>Home is the place where everything comes from.<br>
                        The most important people in my life are my family who raised me, gave me the love and passsion I needed when I was a kid.<br>
                        My childhood was fulfilled with various art relations, therefore I wanted to became an artist myself.<br>
                        57 years ago, at the age of 13, I bought my first tablet and started practicing at digital-art.<br>
                        At the age of 16 I wrote my first script for comic. Two years later I met my hometown friends and we made a cartoon project.<br>
                        In third trimester of University I finally decided to draw comics and release them online and via local publishing houses.
